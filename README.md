# An Incubator for Terrible Ideas

It's like asking ChatGPT if it has any startup ideas,
except it's far less likely to produce anything useful.

* Several word lists and templates were provided by ChatGPT.
* [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) was used, along with the
  [Brown](http://korpus.uib.no/icame/brown/bcm.html)
  and
  [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/)
  corpora, to generate one of the word lists.
* At runtime, powered entirely by [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/).
